This is a new rendition of LFS_Simplebot.

  box requests F)inish & report or X cancel.

New to Library 1.4
* Parameter Editor

  your code from LFS code

Tabs named with following prefixes 

LFS_     LFS code you probably won't need to modify
User      Core user code  (few changes in UserInit)
U           New user code modules (or changed significantly) these 
             contain optional code (except for their methods being present,
             but disabled or empty)
