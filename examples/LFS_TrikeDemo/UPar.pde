 /* UserPar    User Parameter Editor  Support added in LFS library 1.4   
    
    User specifies a list of primitive float and int variables via method calls
    used by parameter editor to create a screen of runtime interactive adjustable values. 
    
    A default value is specified which is assigned to the variable on the first invocation 
    of parEditorUpdate().
       
    This LFS_SimpleBot sketch setup for parameter editing. If you want to modify
    an older LFS sketch to support Parameter Editor, it is easiest to drop your code into
    this sketch, replacing UserCon,UserDraw,UserInit,UserReset tabs with copies of your data.
    
    Of course you will want to make parEditorUpdate to include your own
    float or int variables.
