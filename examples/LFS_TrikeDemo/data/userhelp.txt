This is a new rendition of LFS_Simplebot.
Verified at runtime as SimpleBot4  in top status line on screen.

New to Library 1.4 and SimpleBot (and Demo Trike)

* Parameter Editor 

* Sample program frame work has been cleaned up, better separating
  your code from LFS code 

* Fun new feature, things can happen to your robot if it runs out of bounds.
  See UMisc.

Tabs named with following prefixes 

LFS_     LFS code you probably won't need to modify
User      Core user code  (unchanged in 1.4)
U           New user code modules (or changed significantly) these 
             contain optional code (except for their methods being present,
             but disabled or empty)

Program tab summary appears in LFS_SimpleBot main tab.
Look for LFS-1.4 Changes.pdf to appear on git hub by Oct 23, 2020.

Idea is to replace this file text with your own notes relevant to your robot.
